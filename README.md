## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?


What was most challenging was converting the arrays to BST and BST to DLL, but after working through it and trying different methods, I feel like I was able to figure it out. What was most interesting is how much information one can store in a tree and be able to traverse it with little problem and quickly.
